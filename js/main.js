        Variable naming restrictions:
        1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
        2. The first character must not be a digit.
        NB: $ and _ can also be variable names.
            Cases in javascript also matters .e.g. number and Number are two different variables.
            Non-English letters are allowed but not recommended.
            No use of reserved words e.g. let, return etc as variable names.

    Constants are used for unchanging variables such as own date of birth etc. e.g. const myBirthday;
    Uppercase Constants are used as aliases for the difficult to remember values that are known before execution.
        e.g. const PI = 3.141592653589793

    var is the old-school variable declaration.


    Data types: 
        Number e.g. let result = 1. It can be either floating or integer.

                                Infinity; rep the mathematical infinity âˆž as a result of division by 0 e.g. */

    String Comparisons

        Cases also matters i.e. Letter A and a are not equal. Lowercase 'a' is greater than Upppercase A.

LOGICAL OPERATORS
    There three logical operators:

    - NOT (!)
