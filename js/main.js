/*
        Variable naming restrictions:
        1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
        2. The first character must not be a digit.
        NB: $ and _ can also be variable names.
            Cases in javascript also matters .e.g. number and Number are two different variables.
            Non-English letters are allowed but not recommended.
            No use of reserved words e.g. let, return etc as variable names.

    Constants are used for unchanging variables such as own date of birth etc. e.g. const myBirthday;
    Uppercase Constants are used as aliases for the difficult to remember values that are known before execution.
        e.g. const PI = 3.141592653589793

    var is the old-school variable declaration.


    Data types: 
        Number e.g. let result = 1. It can be either floating or integer.
        Special numeric values  are: 
                                Infinity; rep the mathematical infinity âˆž as a result of division by 0 e.g. */
console.log(5 / 0)
                               /* NaN; rep computational error i.e. as a result of incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation
                                    e.g. */ 
console.log("number"/3)
    /*
        String: it must be sorrounded by quotes
            e.g.*/
let name = "James Kariuki" 
let message = "Hello there"
let message = 'Hello there'
let message = `Hello ${name}` 

console.log(message)

/*
backticks allows embedding of variables and expressions by wrapping with ${}

        Boolean(logical type): it has only two values true and false. e.g. */
let isGreater = 4 > 1; 
console.log( isGreater ) 
        /* results to "yes"

        null: a special value that represents nothing, empty or value unknown. e.g. let gender = null;

        undefined: value is not assigned. e.g. */
let x;
console.log(x); /* the answer displayed is "undefined"

        objects: used to store collectios of data and more complex entities. e.g. hash, array

        typeof: it returns the type of the arguement. Used when one want to do a quick check or when we want 
                to process values of different types differently. either as an operator typeof x or as a function typeof(x).
                e.g. */
typeof "james" // is a string
typeof Math //is an object etc.

// Type conversions
/*
ToString:
    - happens when we need string form of a value.
*/
let yearOfBirth = 1982
yearOfBirth = String(yearOfBirth)
console.log(typeof(yearOfBirth))// results to string
/*

ToBoolean:
    - can be performed with a call to Boolean()
Rules: - values like 0, empty string, null, undefined and NaN results to false.
       - other values result to true.
examples:
*/
let number = 1
number = Boolean(number)
console.log(number)// results to true

let number = 0
number = Boolean(number)
console.log(number)// results to false

let number = ""
number = Boolean(number)
console.log(number)// results to false

let someSpaces = "   "
someSpaces = Boolean(someSpaces)
console.log(someSpaces)// results to true

// However string with 0 results to true
let number = "0"
number = Boolean(number)
console.log(number)// results to true

/*
ToNumber: it happens in mathematical functions and expressions automatically.
e.g. 
*/
console.log( "10" / "5" )
// Strings are converted to numbers 

let salary = "300,000"
console.log(typeof(salary))// results to string.
salary = Number(salary)
console.log(typeof(salary))// results to number

//if the string is not a valid number it results to NaN. e.g.
let fullName = "James Kariuki Kaguna"
fullName = Number(fullName)
console.log(fullName)// results to NaN

let poBox = "747tharaknithi"
poBox = Number(poBox)
console.log(poBox)// results to NaN

let nothing = null
nothing = Number(nothing)
console.log(nothing)//results to 0. However, when I assign a variable with null in JSFiddle, it opens 
                    // a new tab.?????????????

let something = true
something = Number(something)
console.log(something)// results to 1

let something = false
something = Number(something)
console.log(something)// results to 0
