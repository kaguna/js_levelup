/*
        Variable naming restrictions:
        1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
        2. The first character must not be a digit.
        NB: $ and _ can also be variable names.
            Cases in javascript also matters .e.g. number and Number are two different variables.
            Non-English letters are allowed but not recommended.
            No use of reserved words e.g. let, return etc as variable names.

    Constants are used for unchanging variables such as own date of birth etc. e.g. const myBirthday;
    Uppercase Constants are used as aliases for the difficult to remember values that are known before execution.
        e.g. const PI = 3.141592653589793

    var is the old-school variable declaration.


    Data types: 
        Number e.g. let result = 1. It can be either floating or integer.
        Special numeric values  are: 
                                Infinity; rep the mathematical infinity âˆž as a result of division by 0 e.g. */
console.log(5 / 0)
                               /* NaN; rep computational error i.e. as a result of incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation
                                    e.g. */ 
console.log("number"/3)
    /*
        String: it must be sorrounded by quotes
            e.g.*/
let name = "James Kariuki" 
let message = "Hello there"
let message = 'Hello there'
let message = `Hello ${name}` 

console.log(message)

/*
backticks allows embedding of variables and expressions by wrapping with ${}

        Boolean(logical type): it has only two values true and false. e.g. */
let isGreater = 4 > 1; 
console.log( isGreater ) 
        /* results to "yes"

        null: a special value that represents nothing, empty or value unknown. e.g. let gender = null;

        undefined: value is not assigned. e.g. */
let x;
console.log(x); /* the answer displayed is "undefined"

        objects: used to store collectios of data and more complex entities. e.g. hash, array

        typeof: it returns the type of the arguement. Used when one want to do a quick check or when we want 
                to process values of different types differently. either as an operator typeof x or as a function typeof(x).
                e.g. */

ToBoolean:
    - can be performed with a call to Boolean()
Rules: - values like 0, empty string, null, undefined and NaN results to false.
       - other values result to true.
examples:
*/

/*
ToNumber: it happens in mathematical functions and expressions automatically.
e.g. 
*/

let poBox = "747tharaknithi"
poBox = Number(poBox)

let nothing = null
nothing = Number(nothing)
console.log(nothing)//results to 0. However, when I assign a variable with null in JSFiddle, it opens

/*
OPERATORS
    Operand: - this is the quantity on which the operation is to be done.
    e.g.
*/
    console.log(12 - 4) // 12 and 4 are operands while (-) is the operator
/*
    Unary:- when an operator has a single operand
        e.g.
*/
    let number = 3
    number = - number
    console.log( number ) // the result is -3. The operand is 3 which is neagated by operator (-)
/*
    Binary: - when an operator has two operands.
    e.g.
*/
    let yearOfBirth = 1920
    let currentYear = 2019
    age = currentYear - yearOfBirth
    console.log( age ) // yearOfBirth and currentYear are the two operands.
/*
NB: (+) operator has other special usage beside summing numbers in javascript.
    It merges(concatenates) strings.
*/
    let firstName = "James"
    let secondName = "Kaguna"
    let fullName = firstName + secondName
    console.log(fullName)// this returns JamesKaguna.
    //However, to have a space between the two names, you can concatenate a space using a plus
    console.log( firstName+" "+secondName )// Prints James Kaguna.

    console.log(5 + 6 + "6") 
    // this sums the numbers to get 11 and merges with the string "6" to get 116

/*
    Numeric Conversion by unary +
    if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.
    It does the same thing as Number(...) but it's shorter.
    e.g.
*/
    console.log( +false) // result is 0
    console.log( +true) // result is 1
    console.log( +"" )// result 0

    let potatoes = "9"
    let tomatoes = "6"
    console.log( +potatoes + +tomatoes )// result is 15
/*
    Remaider % - this is the remainder after division
    e.g.
*/
    console.log( 10 % 2 )// the remainder is zero

/*
    Exponentiation ** - Multiplying a number by itself the number of times incated
    e.g.
*/
    console.log( 10 ** 3 )// 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000
    console.log( 27 ** (1/3) )// cuberoot of 27 = 3

    Increment/Decrement - increasing or decreasing a number by one which is commonly used.

/*
    Decrement --
*/

    hours--;// same as hours = hours - 1
    console.log( hours )// result is 4
/*
    SOME EXPLANATIONS REQUIRED HERE.
    We need the prefix if we'd like to increase the value and immediately use the result of the operator.
*/
    let counter = 0
    console.log( ++counter )// the result 1
/*
    SOME EXPLANATIONS REQUIRED HERE.
    We need the postfix if we'd like to increment the value but use the previous value.

/*
    Comma: - It allows one to evaluate several expressions dividing them with a comma.

*/
    console.log( 10 * 8, 5 + 3, 20 - 11)// this results to 9
